## ðŸŽ¯ Common Workflows

### Basic Feedback Analysis Workflow

The most common workflow for analyzing customer feedback:

```bash
# 1. Configure your API key
cl config set --api-key your-api-key-here

# 2. Set your product website (helps AI understand your product)
cl team website "https://yourproduct.com"

# 3. Ingest customer feedback
cl ingest "The new dashboard is confusing and hard to navigate"

# 4. Wait for AI analysis (optional)
cl ingest "Customer complaint about performance" --wait

# 5. View AI-generated insights
cl feedback

# 6. Get detailed analysis of specific insight
cl feedback <insight-id>
```

### Advanced Feedback Ingestion

For comprehensive feedback analysis with full context:

```bash
# Ingest with complete metadata
cl ingest "Great product, love the new features!" \
  --title "Positive Customer Feedback" \
  --customer "enterprise-123" \
  --name "Jane Smith" \
  --email "jane@example.com" \
  --url "https://support.example.com/ticket/789"

# List all ingested feedback with pagination
cl ingest --page 1 --limit 20

# Get JSON output for scripting
cl feedback --json | jq '.data[0].title'
```
