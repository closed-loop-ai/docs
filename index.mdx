## üéØ What is ClosedLoop AI?

ClosedLoop AI automatically extracts actionable insights from your sales calls, surveys, and customer interactions, then routes them directly to your product team. **Think of it as your AI-powered feedback translator** - it listens to every customer conversation, understands what they really want, and turns it into structured, actionable product insights.

### **The Problem We Solve**
- **Feedback Chaos**: Customer feedback scattered across calls, emails, surveys, and support tickets
- **Manual Analysis**: Hours spent manually reviewing and categorizing feedback
- **Missed Insights**: Critical customer needs buried in unstructured data
- **Slow Response**: Weeks between customer feedback and product decisions

### **Our Solution**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatically extract insights from any customer interaction
- **Structured Data**: Turn unstructured feedback into actionable product insights
- **Real-Time Processing**: Get insights as they happen, not weeks later
- **Smart Routing**: Direct insights to the right team members automatically
