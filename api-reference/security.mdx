## üîê API Security Overview

ClosedLoop AI takes security seriously. This section covers API security practices, authentication methods, data protection measures, and rate limiting for secure integration.

## üîë Authentication & API Keys

### **API Key Security**
- Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems
- Rotate your API keys regularly for enhanced security
- API keys are tied to your team and inherit your team's permissions

### **Best Practices**
- Never log or print API keys in your application logs
- Use different API keys for different environments (test vs production)
- Monitor your API usage for unusual patterns
- Report any security concerns to security@closedloop.sh

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection

### **Encryption in Transit**
- All API communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.3 encryption
- Webhook endpoints support HMAC signature verification
- API keys are transmitted securely over encrypted connections

### **Data Isolation**
- Customer data is isolated per team with strict access controls
- No cross-team data access or sharing
- Data is processed securely and never stored longer than necessary

### **Data Retention**
- Raw customer data is processed and then securely deleted
- Only AI-generated insights are retained for your team
- You can request data deletion at any time

## üö¶ Rate Limits & Abuse Prevention

### **Rate Limiting**
- **Free Plan**: 100 requests/hour
- **Pro Plan**: 1,000 requests/hour  
- **Enterprise**: 10,000 requests/hour

### **Rate Limit Headers**
All API responses include rate limit information in headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### **Rate Limit Behavior**
- Rate limits are applied per API key
- Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Limits reset at the top of each hour
- Consider implementing exponential backoff for retries

## üîí Webhook Security

### **HMAC Verification**
All webhook endpoints support HMAC signature verification to ensure data integrity:

```bash
# Verify webhook signature
signature = hmac.new(
    webhook_secret.encode('utf-8'),
    request_body.encode('utf-8'),
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

if signature != request_headers['X-Webhook-Signature']:
    return 401  # Unauthorized
```

### **Webhook Best Practices**
- Always verify HMAC signatures
- Use HTTPS endpoints for webhook receivers
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhooks
- Set appropriate timeouts for webhook processing

## üè¢ Enterprise Security

### **Data Residency**
- Data processing occurs in secure data centers
- Customer data remains within specified geographic regions
- Full audit trails for all data access and processing

### **Access Controls**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for team members
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

## üö® Incident Response

### **Security Monitoring**
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Regular security assessments and updates

### **Incident Reporting**
If you discover a security vulnerability or incident:

1. **Email**: security@closedloop.sh
2. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, potential impact
3. **Response**: We'll acknowledge within 24 hours and provide updates


## üìã Data Privacy

### **Privacy Practices**
- Customer data is processed according to privacy best practices
- Data minimization principles are followed
- Users can request data deletion at any time
- Transparent data handling policies

## üîß Security Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Secure API key storage
export CLOSEDLOOP_API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"

# Webhook secret for HMAC verification
export WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-webhook-secret"
```

### **Docker Security**
```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
USER appuser

# Copy only necessary files
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . /app
```

### **Network Security**
- Use VPN or private networks for sensitive integrations
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
