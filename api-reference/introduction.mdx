## What is the ClosedLoop AI API?

The **ClosedLoop AI API** is the brain behind customer feedback automation. It automatically extracts actionable insights from your sales calls, surveys, and customer interactions, then routes them directly to your product team.

**Think of it as your AI-powered feedback translator** - it listens to every customer conversation, understands what they really want, and turns it into structured, actionable product insights.

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except health checks) require authentication via API key in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://mcp.closedloop.sh/feedbacks
```

## Base URLs

- **Production**: `https://mcp.closedloop.sh`

## Security

### üîê **API Key Security**
- Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems
- Rotate your API keys regularly for enhanced security
- API keys are tied to your team and inherit your team's permissions

### üõ°Ô∏è **Data Protection**
- All API communications use HTTPS encryption
- Customer data is processed securely and never stored longer than necessary
- Webhook endpoints support HMAC signature verification
- Data is isolated per team with strict access controls

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Best Practices**
- Never log or print API keys in your application logs
- Use different API keys for different environments (test vs production)
- Monitor your API usage for unusual patterns
- Report any security concerns to security@closedloop.sh

## Rate Limits

### üìä **Plan Limits**
- **Free Plan**: 100 requests/hour
- **Pro Plan**: 1,000 requests/hour  
- **Enterprise**: 10,000 requests/hour

### üö¶ **Rate Limit Headers**
All API responses include rate limit information in headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Rate Limit Behavior**

- Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Limits reset at the top of each hour
- Consider implementing exponential backoff for retries
